# optimal_secure_topology_ws

A framework for simulating multi-robot formation control algorithms using ROS and Gazebo.

WORK IN PROGRESS

### Project Description
Due to the absolute dearth of multi-agent simulations frameworks for ROS (as opposed to ROS2, which recently had ChoiRbot added to its arsenal), this repository was created with the intention to create a unifying simulation framework for testing Networked Control System algorithms on multi-robot systems. This was originally made for simulating attacks on multi-agent formation control algorithms of the Secure Topology Design project under Prof. Vaibhav Katewa's guidance.
